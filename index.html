    <p>Contrary to <b>popular belief</b> <b style="color:blue;">Lorem Ipsum</b>
        is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
      </p>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
      Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from
      a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
      classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
      <p>
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
        et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by <b>Cicero</b>, written in 45 BC.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
        amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
